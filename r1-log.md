### R1D5
Continued working on the D3 Bar Chart. Fetched the data, added the axes with
scale, and started code for adding bars https://codepen.io/jsntime/full/oNgqWWB

### R1D6
Continued working on the D3 Bar Chart. Ran into bugs today and the chart
completely disappeared. Started over to debug, and determined the issue is
something to do with the yScale on the left axis.

### R1D7
Continued working on the D3 Bar Chart. Found the issue with the chart
disappearing - nothing programmatically wrong, simply an extra '.' lingering in
the code. Chart now displays both axes and all bars without proper alignment.

### R1D8
Continued working on the D3 Bar Chart. Didn't make much progress. Got stuck
trying to  get the bars in the rights spots and at the right heights.
